# 🎬 Netflix Homepage Clone

This is a **fully static clone** of the iconic Netflix homepage — built from scratch using **only HTML and CSS**. The project is a creative front-end exercise that brings together visual aesthetics, layout precision, and modern CSS styling, all in one. The layout mimics Netflix’s official landing page closely, giving that familiar cinematic vibe.

> ⚠️ Note: It’s **not responsive yet**, but don’t worry — that’s the next mission!

## 🖼️ What’s Inside?

This project captures the look and feel of Netflix's real homepage. Here's what you’ll find:

* 🔴 **Netflix-style navbar** with the red logo and a Sign In button
* 🖼️ **Fullscreen hero section** with a faded background image overlay
* ✨ Large title and subheading in the center — just like Netflix says “Unlimited movies, TV shows and more.”
* 📧 **Email input field** and a big red **Get Started** button
* 🔥 A trending section showing popular movie covers
* 📦 Hover animations on movie posters for extra flair
* ❓ An FAQ-style section for a realistic layout touch
* 👣 A detailed footer, contact section, and regional selector (like Pakistan 🇵🇰)

All done without JavaScript or libraries — just raw HTML + CSS magic.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* 🧱 **HTML5** – Semantic, structured, and scalable
* 🎨 **CSS3** – For layout, colors, transitions, and effects
* 🧭 **Flexbox** – For responsive-ish alignment (even if the full responsiveness is WIP 😉)
* 🎯 **CSS Variables** – For quick theme updates and consistent styling

## 🎉 The Final Credits

And here’s the part where the screen fades to black... 🎞️
You stuck around till the end of the README — and that’s awesome.

If you're someone who's just starting out, remember:

> 💡 "You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step." — Martin Luther King Jr.

This project might seem simple now, but it’s a building block. One line of code at a time, one pixel adjusted with patience, one bug that took hours to squash — **you’re becoming the developer you’re meant to be**.

Keep learning. Keep experimenting. Break things. Fix them.
And remember…
**Netflix didn’t get built in a day — but your clone? That’s a damn good start! 💪🔥**

Happy coding! 🚀
